Model for triplet energy prediction.
The model available at zenodo is based on the directed message passing neural network as implemented in chemprop (1.6.1) and was trained for 50 epochs on the EnTdecker dataset with the following parameters:
depth = 5
hidden_size=2200
ffn_num_layers = 2
dropout = 0.05
features_generator rdkit_2d_normalized
no_features_scaling
